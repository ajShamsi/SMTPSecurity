# SMTPSecurity
A school management website to integrate SMTP and HTTP protocols

The networking features we tried to implement here :
1. SMTP protocol for user authentication
2. Hashing and salting for password storage and Password reset token
3. HTTP GET and POST methods to communicate with the web server and client(database)



We used Xampp control panel v3.3.0 to connect with MySQL (database management system) 
and phpMyAdmin (web-based administration tool for MySQL).

Used Language : Python
Web Framework : Flask

Other Necessary libraries are installed in the menv virtual environment, 
just run menv\scripts\acticate from command prompt from main directory
then go to cd student management and run python main.python
make sure to start and run the SQL admin to get into the website

ps. better make your own virtual env and just install the libraries 
it asks you to install namely :
1. django
2. flask
3. flask-login
4. flask-mail
5. pillow and some more just do pip install *library name*


this project was for our networking 3111 lab course, we barely got time to do anything properly 
so this version is kinda rusty hehe, kindly bear with it.
